Task: Build an AI-Powered Sentiment Analysis Tool (positive, negative, or neutral) for Movie Reviews (using LLM API)

Requirements:
Frontend:
Create a user-friendly responsive web interface.
Pages required:
Home Page: A form where users can input a movie review (text) and submit it for sentiment analysis.
Results Page: Display the sentiment result (Positive, Negative, or Neutral) with a simple explanation (e.g., "The review contains many positive words").
Backend:
Set up a backend to handle the following:
Accept the review text from the frontend via a POST request.
Analyze the sentiment using a rule-based approach:
Example:
Maintain a list of positive words (e.g., "great," "amazing," "good") and negative words (e.g., "bad," "terrible," "poor").
Count the number of positive and negative words in the review.
Determine the sentiment based on the counts:
Positive > Negative → Sentiment: Positive.
Positive < Negative → Sentiment: Negative.
Equal → Sentiment: Neutral.
Optionally, handle edge cases (e.g., neutral words, negations like "not good").
Return the sentiment result to the frontend via a JSON response.
Database (optional):
Store user reviews and their corresponding sentiment results with timestamps.
Deployment (optional):
Deploy your application and provide the link.

Codebase:
Submit your code in a GitHub repository (ensure it is public or share the access link).
